#Git basic commands

##Create repos

In your app folder, initialize your git repos with :

```
git init
```

##Clone repos

To create a local copy of your repos :

```
git clone /path/to/repository
```

To get a remote repos (on github, bitbucket, gitlab, git server...) :

```
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository
```

##Three

Your local repos is composed of 3 "threes" generated by git
* The first is your workspace which contains your files
* The second is an Index which is a transit area for your files
* Finally the **Head** which pointing on the last commit

Working dir --- add ---> index (stage) --- commit --> HEAD

##Add and validate

To add a file to the index, use 

```
git add <file name>

or 

git add *
```

It is the first step in the basic git workflow. Then to validate some updates :

```
git commit -m "your commit message. be explicit"
```

It will add your file to the **Head** but the file si not yet in your remote repos

##Sending updates

Now you have to send your **Head** in your remote repos

```
git push origin <branch name>

git push origin master
```

If you have not cloned your existing repos and would to connect it with your remote repos, you have to add it before :

```
git remote add origin
```

##Branches

Branches allows you to work on specific features without impact the rest of your project

By default, the **master** branch is created by the init. Then you you can create all the branches you want, but don't forget to merge them with the master when you have finished.

###Create branch

```
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

###Back to master

```
git checkout master
```

###Delete branch

```
git branch -d <branch name>
```

> A new branch is not visible for other users while you have not push it on origin

```
git git push origin
```
